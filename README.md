# MetroFlowRouter

### What is it?
A funny tool to check information about a metro network of your favourites cities!
This tool make use of graph concepts and it uses BFS to find the mininum path from a starting station to another one.
You can use it for every city you want. The only thing you have to do is fill correctly the txt file such as Milan.txt or the other example text files. You must use the same layout.

### Usage Example
```ruby
build metro.go
./metro Milan.txt
```
